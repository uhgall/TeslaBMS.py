# TeslaBMS.py
Simplified and pythonified code to talk to Tesla BMS boards.

Based on https://github.com/tomdebree/TeslaBMS and work done by Colin Kidder.
Runs on a raspberry pi 3B+ with FTDI cable. 

Work in progress.

[4 years later] I lost steam halfway through this, and apparently this worked well enough, given it ran this entire time with no issues.
